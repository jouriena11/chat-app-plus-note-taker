## **Description**

This site was created using EJS, CSS, JavaScript mainly with multiple libraries listed below with the idea in mind to create an MVP for a Chat Support which allows a user to talk in real time with a support user allwoing them to explain their issues and sorting out their ticket on the spot while being given the option to see previous tickets posted so if the issue reappears the user can see how it was solved previously.
